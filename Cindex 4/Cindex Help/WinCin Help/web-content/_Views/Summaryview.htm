		<h2>Summary view</h2>
		<P>The summary view shows only the main headings of entries, together with cross-references made both to and from these entries. Choose <B>Summary</B> from the View menu.</P>
		<p>Records that are the sources of cross-references are displayed to the heading level from which the cross-references originate; records that are the targets of cross-references are displayed to the depth of heading level referred to.</p>
		<p>When Cindex shows the text of a cross-reference made to a heading, it displays the cross-reference in square brackets […] appended to the heading. Each cross-reference is contained in a separate set of brackets. If the cross-reference was from a subheading, the contents of the brackets show the heading and the subheading, after a semicolon.</p>
		<P>When entries are displayed in summary view, Cindex may display <A HREF="../definitions/def_recordstatus.htm">status</A> indicators (in blue) in the left margin.</P>
