		<h2>Viewing the index</h2>
		<P>For each index that is open for work, Cindex uses a single window to display index entries. The title of that window is always the name of the index. Cindex provides several ways for you to view these entries. These range from a fully formatted view that lays out the index exactly as you would see it printed in a book to an unformatted view that makes explicit the structure of the records from which the index is formed. Cindex also allows you to display and work with only parts of the index.</P>
		<P>If you are working in a right-to-left reading language such as Arabic or Hebrew, Cindex will lay out entries correctly as long as it knows the language you are using. Specify the language via Sort settings in the Tools menu. You can override the natural layout by choosing from the Text Alignment submenu in the Character menu.</P>
<p>The toolbar in the window contains tools that control how the index is displayed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">To change the font in which the index is displayed, choose from the font list in the toolbar.
			</li><li type="disc">To change the type size in which the index is displayed, choose (or type) in the type size list.
		</li></ul>
		<p>The bar at the bottom of the window provides information about the  status of the index:</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">Which records are accessible in the view.
			</li><li type="disc">How many records are accessible in the view.
			</li><li type="disc">How many new records have been added in your current session.
			</li><li type="disc">Whether the entries are sorted.
</li></ul>
		<p>Use items in the View menu to choose the kind of view you want.</p>
