		<h2>Viewing a subset of records</h2>
		<p>By default, Cindex displays all records in the index. Cindex can display different subsets of records, as if they were the only records in the index:</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">To view only the records added to your index during your current session with Cindex, choose <b>New Records</b> from the View menu. If the index contains no new records, this item is dimmed. Cindex always displays new records in the order in which you added them to the index.</li><li type="disc">To view only records that have a particular <a href="../_Adding and Editing/Add_labeling.htm">label</a> attached to them, or records that have no label attached to them, choose <b>Hide by Attribute</b> from the View menu. This command is available only when you are working with a fully formatted view.</li><li type="disc">Cindex can form and display an arbitrary set of records as a <a href="../base/Groups.htm">group.</a> A group is usually formed from a selection of records, or as the result of a search.
		
		</li></ul>
		<p>To restore the display of all records choose <b>All Records</b> from the View menu, or by clicking the button in the main toolbar.</p>
