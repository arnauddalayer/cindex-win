		<h2>Draft formatted view</h2>
		<P>To view the index as a draft document, choose <B>Draft Format</B> from the View menu, or click the button in the main toolbar.</P>
		<p>In draft view Cindex displays all records, without hiding any content that it might make invisible in the fully formatted view. In draft view Cindex shows the entries in a standard indented format. You cannot change the indentation, but you can change margins and columns, and line-spacing, through choices from the Document menu. When entries are displayed in draft view, Cindex may display <A HREF="../definitions/def_recordstatus.htm">status</A> indicators (in blue) in the left margin.</p>
		<p>You can customize the draft view in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Showing Record Numbers. As you add each record to the index, Cindex assigns it a unique number. You can use this number (although you never have to) in working with records. To see record numbers check <b>Show Numbers</b> in the View menu. To hide record numbers, uncheck Show Numbers. The initial setting is to hide numbers. Cindex remembers your setting and uses it until you change it again.</li>
		  <li>Depth of Headings to Display. Cindex normally displays all fields in records. You can set it to display only main headings, or only main headings and subheadings, etc. To display headings to a specified depth, choose a heading level from the <b>View Depth</b> submenu in the View menu. The initial setting is to show all levels of headings. Cindex remembers your setting and uses it until you change it again.</li>
</ol>
