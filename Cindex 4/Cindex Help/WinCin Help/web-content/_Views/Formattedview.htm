		<h2>Fully formatted view</h2>
		To view the index as a fully formatted document, choose <B>Full Format</B> from the View menu, or click the button in the main toolbar. The style of index and arrangement of entries are determined by choices you make from the Document menu.
		<p>In this view index entries are displayed in fully finished form, in whatever index style (indented, run-in, etc.) you have specified. Cindex merges duplicate records into single entries, arranges page references and cross-references, and hides any special text you have inserted in records to control alphabetizing. Cindex also hides empty records and deleted records.  Cindex will display labeled records in their distinctive colors if you have enabled that (via a Preferences setting).</p>
<p>In the fully formatted index you can selectively hide records that carry particular <a href="../_Adding and Editing/Add_labeling.htm">labels</a> (or no label at all). To set up hiding, choose <b>Hide by Attribute</b> from the View menu.</p>
		<p>You should always use a fully formatted view when printing the finished index or saving it for typesetting, but because this view obscures the structure of individual records you will probably find that during development of the index it is less useful than a draft formatted view.</p>
