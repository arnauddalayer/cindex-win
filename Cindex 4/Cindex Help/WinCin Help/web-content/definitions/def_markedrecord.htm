		<h3>Marked Records</h3>
		<P>A marked record is one on which Cindex could not complete some global operation, such as replacing text, or altering references, or reconciling headings, usually because there was not enough room in the record to contain the text Cindex would have placed there. The mark merely serves to identify the record, and remains on it until you edit the record.</P>
		<P>In a draft view of the index a marked record is identified by # in the left margin.</P>

<P>To find marked records choose <B>Find…</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu.</P>
