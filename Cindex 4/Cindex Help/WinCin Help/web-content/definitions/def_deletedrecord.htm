		<h3>Deleted Records</h3>
		<P>A deleted record is one that you have marked as deleted (by choosing <B>Delete</B> from the Edit menu). A deleted record is not removed from the index until you choose <B>Compress…</B> from the Tools menu, but it never appears in any fully formatted view of the index.</P>
		<P>In a draft view of the index a deleted record is identified by × in the left margin.</P>

<P>You can find deleted records by choosing <B>Find…</B> from the Edit menu.</P>
