		<h3>Entries</h3>
		<P>An index entry is a complete reference to some material in the work being indexed.</P>
		<P>A index entry consists of a heading and one or more locators (usually page numbers, sometimes cross-references to other entries) that show where the indexed material can be found.</P>

<P>An entry may contain subheadings as well as headings.  Subheadings are used to avoid making headings that would contain too many locators.</P>
