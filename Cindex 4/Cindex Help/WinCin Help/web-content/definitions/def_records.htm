		<h3>Records</h3>
		<P>An index record is Cindex's equivalent of an index card, in which you type an index entry. A record always contains a heading and a page reference or a cross-reference; it may also contain one or more subheadings.</P>
		<P>A record usually, but not always, corresponds to a complete entry in the finished index. Cindex might form an entry in the finished index by merging several records that contain the same headings and subheadings, but different page references or cross-references.</P>
