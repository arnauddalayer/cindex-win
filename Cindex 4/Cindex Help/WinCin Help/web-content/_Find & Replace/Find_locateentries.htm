		<h2>Locating records</h2>
		<p>Use the <b>Go To</b> panel (View menu) to locate records with particular headings and subheadings, or records with particular numbers. You can also use Go To to locate records that would appear on specified pages of the printed index.</p>
		<p>To locate a record by the beginning text of its heading(s), click <b>Record</b>, then type as much leading text as you need from the heading and any subheadings, separating levels of heading with semicolons. For example, to find a record whose main heading begins with 'trade' and its subheading with 'international, you might type:</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>tr;int</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>If the heading you seek begins with a number, place a \ (backslash) immediately before the number.</p>
		<p>To locate a record by its number, click <b>Record</b>, then type the number.</p>
		<p>To locate the record that would lie at the top of a particular printed page, click <b>Page</b>, then type the page number.</p>
		<p>To recall and reuse a previous search specification, choose from the drop-down list.</p>
