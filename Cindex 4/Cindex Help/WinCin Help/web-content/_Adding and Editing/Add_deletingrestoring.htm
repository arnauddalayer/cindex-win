		<h2>Deleting and restoring records</h2>
		To remove a record (or records) from the index, select them in the main document window then check <b>Deleted</b> in the Edit menu (or click the button in the toolbar). A deleted record is not physically removed from the index—it merely becomes hidden when you view a fully formatted index. In a draft or unformatted view, Cindex will identify a deleted record by displaying an <font color="#3300ff">x</font> in the left margin beside it. Deleted records are never displayed in a formatted view.
		<p>To restore deleted records, select them in the main document window and uncheck <b>Deleted</b> in the Edit menu.</p>
		<p>If you are working in the record window you can delete the current record by checking <b>Deleted</b> in the Edit menu. You can restore a deleted record by unchecking <b>Deleted</b>. The status line at the bottom of the record window displays “Deleted” if the current record is deleted.</p>
		<p>You can remove deleted records permanently by choosing <b>Compress…</b> from the Tools menu. Deleted records cannot be restored after you have compressed the index.</p>
