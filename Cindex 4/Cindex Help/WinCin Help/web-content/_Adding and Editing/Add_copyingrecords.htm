		<h2>Copying records from one index to another</h2>
		<p>To copy entries from one index to another, select them in the main index window, then drag them into the main window of the destination index. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the records. Select the records you want, then choose <b>Copy</b> from the Edit menu. Activate the main window of the index into which you want to paste the entries, then choose <b>Paste</b> from the Edit menu.</p>
		<p>If the records in the destination index cannot accommodate as many fields as are contained in the records being dragged or pasted, Cindex will ask you if you want to increase the permitted number of fields.</p>
		<p>If the record size in the destination index is too small to accommodate the records being dragged or pasted, Cindex will ask you if you want to enlarge the record size.</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">

					<p>You cannot undo the drag or paste (although you can delete the dragged or pasted records).</p>
				</td>
