		<h2>Labeling records</h2>
		<P>You can attach a label (a private tag) to any records you choose.  A label serves as a marker you can use for any purpose you choose (for example to identify records that contain incomplete entries). A labeled record is displayed in a distinctive color of your choosing.</P>
		<p>You can use up to 7 different labels to tag records (an individual record may have only one label).</p>
		<P>To label a record or records in the main view, <A HREF="../_Views/Selectingrecords.htm">select</A> them in the main document window then choose from the <B>Labeled</B> submenu of the Edit menu, or choose from the menu attached to the toolbar button (or right-click and choose from the contextual menu).</P>
		<p>To remove a label from a record or records, select the record(s) then either:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Choose from the submenu the label you want to remove. This will remove only the chosen label from records that bear it. It will not affect any selected records that carry different labels.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Choose No Label from the menu. This will remove all labels from selected records.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the record-entry window is open, you can label the current record by choosing from the <B>Labeled</B> submenu, or by choosing from the menu attached to the toolbar button.</p>
        <p>When you add or change a label, Cindex  by default does not mark the record  as 'modified' (i.e., it does not update the date stamp and user identifier). To set whether a label change is considered a modification, choose <b><a href="../base/Prefs_edit.htm">Preferences&hellip;</a></b> from the Edit menu and, under the <b>Edit</b> tab, click <b>Label Sets Change Flag.</b></p>
<p>To set the colors in which you want labeled records displayed, choose <b><a href="../base/Prefs_view.htm">Preferences…</a></b> from the Edit menu then, under the <b>View</b> tab, double click the color cell for the label you want to change. Cindex will display a panel through which you can choose the color you want.</p>
<p>Labeled records are distinctively colored in draft views only; in the fully formatted view labeled records are normally not distinguished from others. To make Cindex distinguish labeled records in the fully formatted view, choose <B><a href="../base/Prefs_view.htm">Preferences…</a></B> from the Edit menu and, under the <B>View</B> tab, check <B>Show in Fully Formatted View.</B></p>
