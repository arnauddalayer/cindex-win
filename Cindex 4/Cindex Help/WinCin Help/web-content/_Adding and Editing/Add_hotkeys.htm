		<h2>Using hot keys</h2>
		<P>Cindex lets you define a set of up to ten keys or keystroke combinations to which you can attach text that will automatically be inserted in a record when you hit the appropriate key or combination. You can also use hot keys to hold text or patterns that you might want when using <B>Find…</B> or <B>Replace…</B> to search for text.</P>
		<P>By default, Cindex defines attachments for two hot keys: <SMALL>SHIFT F1</SMALL> will insert the word <i>See</i> in a record; <SMALL>SHIFT F2</SMALL> will insert the words <i>See also</i>.</P>
		<P>To set up or review the hot keys and their associated text, choose <B>Hot Keys…</B> from the Tools menu.</P>
		<P>To define a hot key, click (or tab to) a field in the left hand column, and enter the keystroke combination (e.g., <SMALL>CONTROL F1</SMALL>) you want to use (do not type the words as you see them in the list, simply enter the keystrokes). If you enter a forbidden keystroke or combination, such as a single letter, Cindex will modify it.</P>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>
					<p>Choose your hot key combinations carefully so as not to conflict with normal key usage by Cindex or by other programs. When you have defined a hot key, that definition replaces any previously assigned use of the key or keys, and prevents Cindex (or any other active application program) from using the key while Cindex is active.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<P>To attach text to a key, type it in the counterpart field to the right. You can also attach text by dragging it or pasting it from another window.</P>
		<P>Text attached to hot keys can be styled (boldface, etc.) and can use the symbol font. Information about other fonts is not preserved. To include style or font attributes in the text attached to a hot key, you must paste or drag into the field the text that contains these attributes.  The most convenient source of text will generally be a selection from the record entry window.</P>
