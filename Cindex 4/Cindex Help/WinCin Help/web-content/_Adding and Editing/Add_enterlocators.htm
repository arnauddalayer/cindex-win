		<h2>Entering locators in records</h2>
		<P>Cindex has powerful capabilities for searching among and modifying locators, for sorting multiple locators that follow a single entry, and for formatting them in different ways. Cindex can employ its capabilities only if knows where to find locators, and how to recognize multiple locators when an entry contains them. Always follow these basic principles when making and editing entries:</P>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">Always put page references and cross-references in the last (locator) field of a record.
			</li><li type="disc">Never mix page references and cross-reference in the same record (make two records if necessary, one containing page references, the other containing cross-references). Cindex provides simple ways to duplicate a record so that you need not type it twice.
			
			</li><li type="disc">To ensure that Cindex can recognize multiple locators when you place more than one in the locator field, use a standard character to separate one reference from the next. This character should not be one that would ever appear within a locator.
			<p>When parsing locator fields Cindex assumes that page references are separated from each other by a comma, and that cross-references are separated from each other by a semicolon. If you want to use other characters as separators, you must designate them explicitly.</p>
