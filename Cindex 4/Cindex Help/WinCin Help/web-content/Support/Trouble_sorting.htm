		<h2>Problems with sorting</h2>
		<p>Here are answers to some frequently-asked questions about sorting entries.</p>
		<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="7" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
			<tr valign="top" bgcolor="#eeeeee">
				<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="98%">
					<p><b>How can I produce a record order sort?</b>  Choose 'Sorted' from the View menu. This switches between a sorted and unsorted view. Without the check mark in front of the menu item your index entries are displayed in record number order.</p>
					<p><b>All of my entries that begin with quotation marks are sorting before the letter A. How do I make them appear in correct alphabetical order?</b> Choose Sort (from the Tools menu) and make sure that you've chosen Word-by-Word or Letter–by–Letter alphabetizing, not 'Simple' alphabetizing. Simple alphabetizing attends to the quote characters, while word-by-word and letter–by–letter alphabetizing ignore them (and other punctuation and symbols).</p>
					<p><b>I am using letter-by-letter sorting, but my index isn't alphabetized. My entries remain in the order in which I enter them.</b> Your view is probaby set to show entries in unsorted order. Check under the View menu that the item Sorted has a check mark next to it. If it doesn't, choose Sorted. (You can also check this by looking at the bottom of the index window, where Cindex displays &quot;Sorted&quot; or &quot;Unsorted&quot;).</p>
					<p><b>I have asked Cindex to ignore &quot;the&quot; when sorting the index, but it doesn't.</b> There are two conditions under which Cindex will not ignore &quot;the&quot;:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>• You are using Simple alphabetizing. Cindex does not ignore articles or prepositions when you use &quot;simple&quot; alphabetizing. You must use word-by-word or letter-by-letter alphabetizing (choose Sort from the Tools menu).<br>
								• Even if you are using word-by-word or letter-by-letter alphabetizing, Cindex will ignore &quot;the&quot; only if it is the first word in a sub-heading. Cindex does not ignore leading articles and prepositions in main headings. If you want Cindex to ignore &quot;The&quot; as a leading word in a main heading, place the word to be ignored inside angle-brackets, as in &lt;The &gt;Wind in the Willows.</p>
