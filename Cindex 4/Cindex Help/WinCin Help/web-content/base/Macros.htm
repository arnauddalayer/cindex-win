		<h2>Macros</h2>
		<p>Macros provide a way to encapsulate a long or complex series of operations as a single command. Cindex can create a macro by recording a sequence of  keystrokes that complete some operation on an index. You can then invoke this recorded sequence by choosing the command to replay the macro.</p>
		<h3>Using Macros</h3>
		<p>To start recording mouse or keystroke events, choose the <b>Record Events</b> submenu from the Tools menu. Then choose <b>Record Macro</b> (you can record and save up to 10 macros). Until you stop recording, Cindex will remember every keystroke and mouse click.</p>
		<p>To stop recording, hit <small>CONTROL BREAK</small> (the break key is next to the keyboard status lights). Cindex will then display a box into which you can type a short name you will subsequently use to refer to that macro. Cindex remembers a recorded macro (even between different sessions with Cindex) until you record a new one.</p>
		<p>To replay a recording, choose the <b>Play Events</b> submenu from the Tools menu, then choose the macro that you want to replay. Items are dimmed if no macros have been recorded). Cindex will execute the series of mouse clicks and keystrokes you had previously recorded.</p>
