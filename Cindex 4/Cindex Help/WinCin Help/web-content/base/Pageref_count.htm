		<h2>Checking page references</h2>
		<p>Checking page references is available as part  of a comprehensive  check via <b>Check Index&hellip;</b> (Tools menu).</p>
<p> Open the panel, click the References tab, then make settings under <b>Page References</b>.</p>
<p>Check <strong>Missing</strong> to find  records that lack a cross-reference or a page reference. When checking for a cross-reference, Cindex will accept one in a subheading (as an alternative to the locator field) if you have unchecked <em>Recognize cross-references in locator field only</em> in <strong>Reference Syntax</strong>&hellip;(Document menu).</p>
<p>At <b>More than <em>n</em> undifferentiated </b> enter the maximum number of locators acceptable in an entry.</p>
<p>Check <strong>Overlapping ranges</strong> to find cases where a single reference is duplicated, or a single reference or a range of references overlaps another range.  When dealing with references that contain non-numerical suffixes, (e.g., 37t), or are styled (e.g., <em>522</em>), Cindex examines them for potential overlap only if the suffix is the same, or the style is the same. When dealing with compound (multi-part) locators (e.g., 25a:64), Cindex examines them for potential overlap only if all segments but the last are identical.</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>When producing a formatted Index, Cindex can automatically suppress the redundant parts of overlapping references (see settings under <b>Page References</b> in the Document menu), so you need not check for them unless you think they need attention as potential errors.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
<p>Check <strong>On headings above lowest</strong> if you want to identify entries in which any heading level above the lowest subheading has a reference attached to it.</p>
		<p>If Cindex finds  errors it  displays them in the check results. Each entry in the list identifies the source record and the nature of the error.		</p>
		<p>Click any item in the list to bring its record into view in the main document window; double-click the item (or hit <small>RETURN</small>) to open a window in which to edit its record.</p>
