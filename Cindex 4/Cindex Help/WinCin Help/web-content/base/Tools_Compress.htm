		<h2>Removing unwanted records</h2>
		<p>Use the <b>Compress</b> panel (Tools menu) to remove unwanted records from the index.</p>
		<p>To remove records that contain no text check <b>Remove Empty Records</b>.</p>
		<p>To remove deleted records check <b>Remove Deleted Records</b>.</p>
		<p>To remove exact duplicates check <b>Remove Duplicated Records</b>.</p>
		<p>To remove records that contain automatically-generated cross-references check <b>Remove Generated Records</b>.</p>
		<p>As you build an index you might create several records that are identical except for their page references or cross-references. To simplify the organization of records, Cindex can merge the identical entries, putting all their page references and cross-references into as few records as possible, and deleting any unnecessary records that result. To consolidate references, and to remove records that are no longer needed, check <b>Consolidate References</b>. By default, Cindex does not consolidate references from otherwise identical records that carry different labels. To make Cindex ignore labels, check <b>Ignore Different Labels</b>. When this is checked, a merged record carries the label (if any) of the first of the merged set.</p>
		<p>You need not consolidate references—Cindex always merges duplicate entries when it displays or prints the formatted index—but you can reduce the size of your index by doing so.</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>
					<p>Cindex cannot consolidate references or remove duplicated records if the index is sorted in page number order, in which case these items are dimmed.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr valign="top">
				<td rowspan="2">
					<p>When Cindex removes records from an index it renumbers those that remain. You should not rely on a record having the same number before and after you compress an index. Cindex uses a record’s number to keep track of its membership in any <a href="Groups.htm">group</a>. Because record numbers often change when you compress an index, Cindex invalidates all its groups.</p>
