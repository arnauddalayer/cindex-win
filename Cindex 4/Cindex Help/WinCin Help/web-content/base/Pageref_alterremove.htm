		<h2>Removing page references</h2>
		<p>Use the <b>Alter References </b>panel (Tools menu) to remove specified page references from records.</p>
		<p>Follow these steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li type="1">Under Scope choose whether you want to remove All References accessible in the current view, or those falling within a specified range. To set a range click Range, and enter the lowest and highest page numbers that should be removed. You must specify at least one limit (high or low) of the range of references to be removed. If you specify only an upper limit Cindex assumes the lower limit to be 1. If you specify only a lower limit, Cindex assumes the upper limit to be all higher references.<br />
				<br />
				If your locators are compound references, (e.g., 23:14:2 or 34[2]:25–27), Cindex will normally identify them by their first components. To make Cindex attend to another part of a compound reference, you can provide at Matching Pattern a <a href="Patterns_defining.htm">pattern</a> to specify leading parts of references that Cindex should skip to find the element you want.
			</li><li type="1">Under Action click <b>Remove References</b>. When Cindex removes page references, it normally adjusts all references to higher-numbered pages. You can inhibit this adjustment (if you want to leave room for new material) by checking <b>Hold Higher Values</b>.</li><li type="1">If you want to add an additional offset to (or subtract one from) the automatic adjustment of references to higher numbered pages, specify it in <b>Adjustment</b>. You might want to provide an adjustment if, for example, some different number of new pages will replace those removed.</li></ol>
		<p>References needing adjustment may be intermixed in a record with others that do not need adjustment; Cindex disregards references that fall outside the range you have specified.</p>
		<p>Cindex removes only references in Arabic numerals. It copes intelligently with references that specify a range of page numbers (e.g., 45–60). If either the high or the low limit falls within the range defined by such a reference, it is adjusted appropriately.</p>
