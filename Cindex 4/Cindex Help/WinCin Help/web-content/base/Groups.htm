		<h2>Making groups</h2>
		<P>You can define sets (&quot;groups&quot;) of records that you can work with as though they were the only records in the index. This provides a convenient method for you to manage the entries in large indexes.</P>
		<P>You can make a group from selected records in the main index window, or from the results of a search using <b>Find</b> (Edit menu).</P>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">To make a group from records you have selected in the main window, choose New Group from the File menu (also available through the contextual menu Cindex displays when you control-click or right-click in the main window).
			</li><li type="disc">To make a group from records that contain specified text or have particular attributes, choose <b>Find…</b> from the Edit menu, set up your search, then click <b>Find All</b>. Cindex will examine all the records that could be displayed in the current view and will form a group from those that meet your search criteria.
		</li></ul>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>
					<p>Cindex also automatically makes a temporary group when you <a href="../_Adding and Editing/Add_duplicatingrecords.htm">duplicate a selection of records</a>.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<P>When Cindex makes a group it gives it the name &quot;Temporary Group&quot; and automatically displays it in the main window.</P>
		<p>To restore the view of all records, choose <b>All Records</b> from the View menu. To view the group choose <b>Temporary Group</b> from the View menu.</p>
		<P>The temporary group survives until you make a new one, or until you save it as a permanent group (see below) or finish your session with Cindex.</P>
		<p>You can search among the records in a group, or view the fully formatted entries in it. You can sort a group differently from the main index.</p>
		<p>To save a temporary group as a permanent one that you can recall at any time, first make sure it is on view (if necessary, choose Temporary Group from the View menu), then choose <b>Save Group…</b> from the File menu (or the contextual menu you obtain with right-click in the main window). Cindex automatically associates the saved groups  with their parent index.</p>
		<p>To view records in a saved group, choose the group by name from the <b>Group</b> submenu in the View menu (this item is dimmed if the index contains no saved groups).</p>
