		<h2>Checking references</h2>
		<p>Use the <b>Check Index</b> panel (Tools menu) to check the validity and appropriateness of cross-references and page references.</p>
		<p>Cindex can verify cross-references, checking that they refer correctly to record(s), that they are not circular, and that they are of the right type (e.g., see or see also). To help you decide when double-posting would be preferable to making a cross-reference, Cindex can also identify cross-references made to a heading under which there are fewer than a specified number of entries.</p>
		<p>To verify cross-references click the<b> References</b> tab and <a href="Crossref_verify.htm">make settings</a> in the Cross-References box.</p>
		<p>If an entry contains many page references it may be desirable to break it up into several more qualified entries. Cindex can count the page references associated with  entries and warn you about entries  that contain more than a specified number of references. Cindex can also warn you about overlapping ranges of references.</p>
		<p>To check page references click the <b> References</b> tab and <a href="Pageref_count.htm">make settings</a> in the Page References box.</p>
