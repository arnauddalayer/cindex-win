		<h2>Managing groups</h2>
		<P>To get information about how and when groups were formed, to delete them, to add cross-references to them, or to rebuild them by applying the search criteria used in their formation, choose <B>Groups...</B> from the Tools menu (this item is dimmed if the index has no groups).</P>
		<P>To get information about a group, choose its name from the <b>Group</b> dropdown list, then click <B>Info…</B>. Cindex will display a panel that provides information about the group and how it was formed.</P>
		<p>You can undertake the following operations on the single group chosen in the dropdown list, or on all groups.</p>
		<p>Choose first the action you want to undertake on a group or groups:</p>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">To rebuild one or all groups that belong to an index click Rebuild. Cindex knows how a group was made originally (e.g., from a search, or from a selection of records). If a group was made from a search, Cindex can rebuild it using the original search criteria.
			
			</li><li type="disc">To remove a group choose the group you want to delete from the Group pop-up menu (or click All Groups if you want to remove all of them), then click Delete. When Cindex removes a group it deletes only the information it has stored about which records belong to the group; Cindex does nothing to the records themselves.
			</li><li type="disc">To add to a group all the records that make cross-references to records already in it, click Link Cross-References (this is dimmed if the index is not sorted alphabetically). Cindex will examine all records in the index, and will add to each group any record that contains a cross-reference to a record already in it.
		</li></ul>
		<P>Choose the scope of the action:</P>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">Click <b>All Groups</b> to make Cindex act on all groups that belong to the index.
			</li><li type="disc">Choose from the <b>Group</b> drop-down list the name of the individual group on which Cindex should act.
		</li></ul>
