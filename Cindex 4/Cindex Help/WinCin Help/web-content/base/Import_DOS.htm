		<h2>Importing indexes from Cindex for DOS</h2>
		<P>Cindex for Windows can open and use these files made by the legacy program Cindex for DOS:</P>
		<ul>
			<li type="disc">Index files (those with the .ndx filename extension) made by Cindex <i>Version 6.0 and higher.</i>
			</li><li type="disc">Files containing backup records (those with the .dat filename extension) made by any version of Cindex for DOS.</li></ul>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td>
					<p>Cindex for Windows cannot open directly an index created by Cindex for DOS version 5 or below. To use such an index, you must open it with the version of Cindex used to create it, then use the command WRITE to export the index records. Use Cindex for Windows to create a new index, then import the records you have written.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<P>To open and convert an index made by Cindex for DOS, start Cindex, then choose <B>Open</B> from the File menu. From the <B>Files of type</B> drop-down list choose <I>Indexes</I> to display DOS indexes, then choose the file you want to convert.</P>
		<P>When Cindex for Windows converts an index made by Cindex for DOS, with the exceptions noted below it preserves  format and layout settings, translates all text attributes, and converts special DOS characters into their Windows counterparts. When importing index records from a DOS backup file (one with the .dat filename extension), Cindex translates attributes and special characters into their Windows counterparts.</P>
		<h3>Important Conversion Issues</h3>
		<P>If Cindex for Windows encounters a character it cannot translate when converting a DOS index, or reading records from a DOS backup file, it will represent that character by the Unicode unknown character &#xfffd; and it will ‘mark’ the record that contains the character. If Cindex has marked any records it will alert you when it has finished the conversion. You can use the Find command (Edit menu) to find any marked records</P>

<P>The \g…\G and \h…\H attribute codes, available for use in Cindex for DOS, have no counterparts in Cindex for Windows. When Cindex for Windows opens a .ndx or .dat file it checks for the presence of these attributes. If they have been used in the file, Cindex will warn you and invite you to translate them into distinctive <I>fonts</I>. If you decline to translate these attribute codes, they will be discarded from the records during conversion.</P>
		<P>Cindex for Windows does not convert record groups that belong to the index being converted. You will need to re-create these after conversion.</P>
