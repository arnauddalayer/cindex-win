		<h2>Managing abbreviations</h2>
		<h3>Saving and loading abbreviations</h3>
<P>Cindex works with one active set of abbreviations, and when you define a new abbreviation Cindex always adds it to the active set. You can maintain multiple sets of abbreviations for use on different occasions.  Cindex keeps track of the set you last used, and automatically opens it when you start a new session.</P>
<P>To load and use an existing set of abbreviations, choose <B>Load&hellip; </B>from the <strong>Abbreviations</strong> submenu in the Tools menu.</P>
<P>To start a new set of abbreviations, choose <B>New&hellip;</B> from the <strong>Abbreviations</strong> submenu in the Tools menu.</P>
        <P>To close the active set of abbreviations, choose <B>Close</B> from the <strong>Abbreviations</strong> submenu in the Tools menu.        </P>
        <h3>Viewing and editing abbreviations</h3>
        <P>To edit abbreviations choose <strong>Edit&hellip;</strong> from the <B>Abbreviations</B> submenu in the Tools menu.</P>
<p>To add a new abbreviation, choose <B>New Abbreviation</B> from the Edit menu. Cindex will display, at the bottom of the current list, the name 'NEW'. Change this to the name you actually want to use. The name may contain up to eight characters, except a space and these punctuation marks:</p>
		<blockquote>
		  <p> ( ) [ ] &quot; “ ” ' ‘ ’ , . ; :</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>When you have named the abbreviation hit <SMALL>TAB</SMALL> (or click to the right of the name) to enter the text to be represented by it. To apply a style to any part of the text, select the text and choose the style from the <B>Character</B> menu.</p>
		<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
			<tr valign="top">
				<td width="98%">
					<p>You can also define abbreviations <a href="../_Adding and Editing/Add_usingabbreviations.htm">directly in records</a> as you work on them.</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<P>To edit an existing abbreviation, simply change its name or the text attached to it.</P>
		<P>To delete an existing abbreviation, select both its name and the text associated with it (or triple-click the line), then choose <B>Clear</B> from the Edit menu (or hit <SMALL>DELETE</SMALL>).</P>
		<P>You can view abbreviations sorted alphabetically by the expanded phrase, or sorted alphabetically by name. To change the order click the title to the column on which you want to sort.</P>
		<p>When the editing window is active, you can save your  abbreviations by choosing <B>Save</B> or <B>Save&nbsp;As&hellip;</B> from the File menu. (If you have unsaved changes to abbreviations, Cindex will always ask you, before quitting, if you want to save the changes.) </p>
		<p>Cindex remembers abbreviations after you close the  editing window.</p>
