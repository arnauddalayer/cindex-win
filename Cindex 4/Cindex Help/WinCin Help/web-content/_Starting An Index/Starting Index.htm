		<h2>Creating an index</h2>
		<P>To start a new index choose <B>New...</B> from the File Menu. Cindex will display a panel through which you can name the index and select a folder to contain it. (Unlike a word-processor, Cindex cannot work with a new “untitled” document—you must create and name a new document before you make entries). Click <B>Save</B> to create the index.</P>
		<p>When you create an index, Cindex provides standard settings for certain properties of the index <A HREF="../definitions/def_records.htm">records</A> that will contain <A HREF="../definitions/def_entries.htm">entries.</A> For example, Cindex sets a limit on the number of characters that a record can hold. You can change these properties before you create the new index, or at any time afterward. To change the properties of the records before you create the new index, click <B>Options...</B> before you click Save.</p>
		<p>When you click Save, Cindex will open a new document window in which the index entries are displayed as you make them. Most of your commerce with the index will be through this window. When you close this window, you close and save the index document.</p>
		<P>Cindex can also create a new index from a template—an existing index that serves as a model for the new one. The new index inherits all its settings from the template.</P>
		<p>Cindex creates each new index with a standard set of attributes that specify such things as the index style and method of alphabetizing entries. You can change these attributes at any time.</p>
