		<h2>Elements of an index</h2>
		<p>A Cindex index is a collection of <A HREF="../definitions/def_entries.htm">entries</A> that you can view and print in any form you wish and in any order you wish. Each entry is a complete reference to some material in the work being indexed. Cindex maintains each index entry as a distinct entity in the document, so that it can display entries in the style and order that you prefer.</p>
		<p>An index entry consists of a <a href="../definitions/def_headings.htm">heading</a> and one or more <a href="../definitions/def_locator.htm">locators</a> (usually page numbers, sometimes cross-references to other entries) that show where the indexed material can be found. An entry may contain <i>subheadings</i> as well as headings. Subheadings are used to avoid making unqualified headings that would otherwise contain too many locators.</p>
		<p>Cindex can display and print entries in any order and in a wide variety of formats, as long as you prepare entries in a standard way. To help you do this, Cindex uses <A HREF="../_Adding and Editing/Add_aboutrecords.htm">records</A> to hold the text of index entries. A record is the computer’s equivalent of an index card. A record always contains a heading and a page reference or a cross-reference; it may also contain one or more subheadings.</p>
		<p>A record is usually, but not always, equivalent to an index entry. When Cindex displays or prints a formatted index it may combine several records (identical except perhaps for page references or cross-references) to form a single entry.</p>
