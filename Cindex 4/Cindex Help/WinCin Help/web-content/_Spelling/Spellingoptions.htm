		<p>Choose language and other spelling preferences via <b>Options…</b> in the <b>Spelling</b> panel (Edit menu).          </p>
		<ul>
		  <li type="disc">Check in Additional Dictionaries (if any are available) any supplementary dicitonaries you want to use in addition to the main language dictionary.
		  </li><li>To make Cindex seek alternative spellings whenever it finds an unknown word, click Always Suggest. To make Cindex suggest spellings only when you request them, uncheck Always Suggest. Cindex will then suggest alternatives only when you click Suggest in the main spelling window.
		  </li><li type="disc">To make Cindex ignore words in capitals (often abbreviations or acronyms) check Ignore Words in CAPS.
			</li><li type="disc">To make Cindex ignore alphanumeric character sequences such as aa99 or 9b32, check Ignore Alphanumerics; if you leave this item unchecked, Cindex will treat all such sequences as misspelled words.
			</li><li type="disc">Each time you click Ignore All when checking a document, Cindex adds the word to be ignored to a private list that it maintains for the duration of your current session. Cindex discards this list when you quit. If you want to clear that list without quitting, so that Cindex forgets the words you had told it to ignore, click Clear Ignore List.
			
			</li>
		  <li type="disc">To examine or edit the words in a personal dictionary, choose the dictionary you want from the list under Personal Dictionary, then click Edit. You can add, change or delete words freely, and you can paste text from other documents. Words may be in any order, but each must be on a separate line, or be separated from the next by some space.<br />
		    To create a new, empty, personal dictionary, click New. Cindex will display a box in which you can type the name of the new dictionary.
		    <br />
	      To delete a personal dictionary, click Delete.		  </li>
